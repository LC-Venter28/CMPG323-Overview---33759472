# __CMPG323-Overview-33759472:__

## __Repositories used:__

 For the project I intend to make use of different repositories for each Project along with editing the Main Project repository accordingly.
 The repositories will be as follows:
  * CMPG323-Overview
  * CMPG323-Project-2
  * CMPG323-Project-3
  * CMPG323-Project-4
  * CMPG323-Project-5
  * CMPG323-POE
  
 *As for the repositories I used for each Project some differed from what I initially planned:*
 *For Project 3 I used a forked repository instead of creating my own.*
 *There is not a Repository for the PoE as it does not require it.*

## __Project/Repository Diagram:__

 As shown in the above image, I will make use of a Repository for each new Project which will then be added to the
 overarching Overview Repository.

## __Branching Strategy:__

 During this project I will make use of 2 branches.
 The main will be used when I have finished certain aspects of the Projects in the Develop branch.
 
 * Main
 * Develop
 
 *Through the course of these Projects we had I struggled a lot with the implementing of my branching strategy.*
 *Therefore, I did not make use of it with the finalizing of my Projects.*
  

## __Use of .gitignore:__

Every project I am working on has sensitive information that cannot be accessed from the public. Therefore, I will use the .gitignore to ignore these sensitive files  when adding to the repositories.
*At the end of these Projects I only needed to use the .gitignore in 2 of my 5 repositories namely: Project 2 and Project 3.*

## __Storage of Credentials:__

 As for the storage of credentials I plan on adding most of my personal credentials to the .gitignore for security reasons.
 But where necessary I will provide the needed credentials in order for the project to work.
